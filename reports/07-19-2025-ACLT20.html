      <h2>🎯 Bowling First – The Gladiators' Fightback Begins 💪</h2>
      <p>
        The game couldn’t have started tougher – Warriors exploded with 60 runs in just the first 3 overs! But here’s where our Gladiator grit shone through.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Akhil</strong> broke the rampant opening stand with a pressure-lifting wicket at a pivotal moment. At 84/1 after the powerplay, the momentum began to swing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then came <strong>Pavan</strong>, spinning a web around the middle overs with mastery, aided wonderfully by <strong>Kartik</strong>, who bowled a composed and accurate spell to contain the run flow.
      </p>
      <p>
        And what a sensational finish from our <strong>Yorker King – Sandeep</strong> 💥! Under immense final-over pressure, he bagged 3 wickets to end an incredible 3-over spell with 4 wickets for 21 runs. From a point where 250 looked inevitable, we restricted the Warriors to <strong>195/8 in 20 overs</strong>. An elite fightback!
      </p>

      <h2>🏏 Chasing 196 – Courage and Grit at the Crease</h2>
      <p>
        The chase didn’t begin as planned – both openers fell early. But <strong>Prithvi</strong> stepped up with intent, launching a quickfire 37 off 23 that kept the pressure on the bowlers and the scoreboard ticking.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Shushruth</strong> provided great support with a steady 35, keeping the innings together during a tricky phase. Later in the innings, <strong>Sukesh</strong> played some stylish strokes in the attempt to close the gap.
      </p>
      <p>
        Despite positive efforts, the Warriors’ bowling held firm in the back end of the innings, and we eventually closed the innings at <strong>146/8</strong>, falling 49 runs short.
