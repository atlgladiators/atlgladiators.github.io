    <div class="section">
      <p>Hello Team,</p>
      <p>
        What a fantastic game it was! Although we couldn‚Äôt secure the victory today, we‚Äôve walked away with valuable lessons that will make us stronger and better as a team (including myself as a captain).
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>We won the toss by default</strong> because not enough players of opposition team was available.<br>
        This is power of being on time and I really appreciate that all made an effort to being on time and I am really thankful for it.
      </p>
      <p>We decided to bat first.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Batting Summary</h2>
    <div class="section">
      <p>
        We got off to a dream start, thanks to Kartik‚Äôs explosive hitting and Srikanth‚Äôs solid support. Scoring <strong>50/1 in the powerplay</strong> was brilliant. However, we slowed down between overs 6‚Äì15, which created some pressure. But what a comeback in the last 5 overs! Prem Patel‚Äôs fireworks and Ankit‚Äôs composed finish took us to a competitive total of <strong>166/8</strong>. As a team, we hit <strong>15 boundaries and 4 sixes</strong>-an excellent display of power and strategy. Kudos to all the batters for playing to the situation.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h2>Bowling Summary</h2>
    <div class="section">
      <p>
        Our bowling started with a bang! Atul and Ankit delivered an outstanding powerplay, picking up <strong>5 wickets in the first 6 overs</strong>. By the 8th over, we had 6 wickets, and the game was ours. However, I made a critical decision to bowl myself instead of using our strike bowlers-Sukesh, Sandeep, Kartik, Trilok, and Prem-who were all available. This decision shifted the momentum, as the opposition took advantage and scored freely. While our bowlers gave their best, regular boundaries (19 fours and 2 sixes) from the opposition kept them ahead of the game. Nevertheless, special mention goes to Ankit for his 3 wickets and Atul for his powerplay magic.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h2>Fielding Performance</h2>
    <div class="section">
      <p>
        Our fielding was solid today. We took all our catches and put in a great effort overall.
        While the large ground allowed the opposition to sneak in a few extra runs, there‚Äôs no doubt that our fielders put their hearts into it. Excellent work, team!
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="best-moments">
      <h2>Best Moments Today</h2>

      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="areas-improve">
      <h2>Areas to Improve</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Batting:</strong> We bat deep, so we must maintain a steady scoring rate and avoid building pressure on ourselves by playing lots of dot balls and by not scoring boundaries regularly. Let‚Äôs aim to keep the scoreboard moving with good run rate.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Running Between Wickets:</strong> Let‚Äôs work on completing the first run faster and seizing opportunities for twos. These quick runs can make a huge difference.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Bowling:</strong> Our bowlers should focus and practice more on nailing yorkers, full lengths, and cross-seam deliveries while avoiding unnecessary short balls. Building partnerships as bowlers is equally as important as batting partnership.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Bowling Dot Balls:</strong> Let‚Äôs create pressure by delivering more dot balls and bowling to the field. All the bowlers should have same mindset of bowling best six balls of the over and giving as less runs as possible rather than focusing on getting wickets. If we build pressure from both end then wickets will automatically follows.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Most importantly, always trust your skills, your practice, and your captain and your team.</strong> Remember, your captain has full faith in every one of you.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

      <h2>Final Words</h2>
