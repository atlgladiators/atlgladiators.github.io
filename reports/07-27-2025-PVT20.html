      <h2>🎯 Second Innings – Anant Leads Ruthless Bowling Attack</h2>
      <p>
        Defending 194, the Gladiators’ bowling unit delivered a near-flawless performance. <strong>Govind Erra</strong> struck early, removing Aamer and Srinivas. The deadly spell came from <strong>Anant</strong>, who was unplayable – finishing with 6 wickets in 4 overs, derailing the middle and lower order with ruthless consistency.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Aryan</strong> got the last wicket, while <strong>Mihir, Rohith, Bhavin</strong and <strong>Rahul</strong> kept things tight. The Lorven Lords were bowled out for <strong>107 in 18.4 overs</strong>, handing the Gladiators a massive <strong>86-run victory</strong>.
