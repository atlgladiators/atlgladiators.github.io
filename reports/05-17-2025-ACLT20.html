  <h1>🏏 Match Summary: ACL CBL vs Raptors 🏏</h1>
  <p>
    Despite rain delays, everyone arrived on time and the umpires decided on a 16-over match.<br>
    Winning the toss, we chose to bowl first, hoping to use the wet pitch to our advantage. Unfortunately, things didn't go as planned.

  <p>
    <span class="highlight">Our bowling performance fell way short of expectations.</span><br>
    • A total of <b>20 boundaries</b> and <b>11 sixes</b> were conceded, allowing <b>146 runs solely from boundaries</b>.<br>
    • The ball was swinging and spinning, yet we struggled to control it due to the wet conditions.
  </p>
  <h3>The biggest concerns:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Bowlers set up field placements but did not consistently bowl to the field planned with the captain.</li>
    <li>Too many full tosses, some of which turned into no-balls.</li>
    <li>Bowling on the batsman’s hips gave away easy runs.</li>
    <li>At least <b>5 boundaries and 6 sixes</b> were purely due to loose deliveries.</li>
    <li>Some bowlers delivered 4 good balls but then experimented unnecessarily, conceding crucial runs.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Lack of discipline hurt us badly, with minimal dot ball pressure applied.<br>
    We need to build a mindset of finishing overs strongly without giving away freebies.<br>
    <b>Result:</b> Raptors scored <b>202 for 3 wickets</b>.<br>
    <b>Wickets:</b> Trilok (2), Pavan (1), plus a runout.

<div class="section">
  <h2>Batting Performance</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Unfortunately, our batting failed as a unit.</li>
    <li>Poor shot selection and taking the game lightly cost us heavily (including my own dismissal).</li>
    <li>Two unnecessary runouts were major setbacks.</li>
    <li>Each batsman had the chance to play a big innings but failed to capitalize.</li>
    <li><b>Sushruth stood out</b>, utilizing his batting opportunity well.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <h2>Fielding Positives</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Fielding was a bright spot with everyone putting in a solid effort.</li>
    <li><b>Sukesh’s two catches were simply incredible.</b></li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <h2>Areas for Improvement</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Maintain high energy levels while fielding-self-motivation is key! Mithil &amp; Akshay tried to pump the team up from the sidelines, and Sushruth led by example on the field.</li>
    <li>Play with intent and responsibility, value your own wicket when batting and bowl as per your strengths.</li>
    <li>Practice hard and play confidently.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><span class="highlight">Tough day, but lessons learned 😒</span></p>
</div>

<div class="thanks">
  <b>Special Thanks</b> to Mithil &amp; Akshay for supporting us &amp; staying throughout the game.<br>
  Heartfelt thanks to Mithil for setting up the tea station and making special tea for everyone 🙏🏼🙏🏼<br>
  Love you man for that 😘😘
