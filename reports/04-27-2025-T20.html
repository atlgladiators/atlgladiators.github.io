  <h4>PVCL Spring T-20 2025 – April 27, 2025</h4>
    <p><b>1..2..3.. Go Glads..!!!</b></p>

      <li>Match report:</li>
      <li>Before getting into the match report, I would like to cheer for the entire team to be focused on being undefeated in the first leg of the season 1..2.. 3.. Go Glads..!!! Couple of call outs..
        <br><b>Aryan</b> is giving his final exams this week and last week, but made the effort to fly from Raleigh and play. <b>Big thanks</b> – it's not easy what he did in the past couple of weeks.</li>
      <li><b>Rushi</b> has been consistently flying from NJ to make sure we do well here. Just having him on the side gives the entire team a sense of relief, but again, what he does is not easy – managing family, NJ cricket commitments, and his job. It's a lot. We as a team need to figure out how we can contribute to the efforts and commitment from both Aryan and Rushi. <b>Big cheers to both of them.. 1..2..3.. Go Glads..!!</b></li>
      <li>There are multiple other players who are local here and are giving their 110% this year. Thanks to all, and big cheers for all of you.<br>
        <b>1..2..3.. Go Glads..!!</b>

      <li><b>Toss:</b> It was crucial. The pitch was wet, so it was obvious to win and bowl first. The ball was gripping, it bounced, but it was a very slow track and difficult to bat on early in the morning. We won the toss and put the opposition in to bat first – honestly, a good toss to win.</li>
      <li><b>Bowling:</b> As a new team, we are doing a lot of things right, one of them being knowing our roles and delivering on expectations so far. Let's keep building on this.</li>
      <li>Govind and Krishna provided a great start and our fielders did a great job of supporting them and all other bowlers. Akhil and Ansh made sure we kept their batsmen under pressure and kept on getting wickets at regular intervals – we never let the opposition off the hook.</li>
      <li>Rushi bowled his 4 overs and dismantled the opposition by grabbing 3 wickets from the other end. Then our fast bowlers Krishna, Govind, and Akhil just finished up the tail. Akshay also bowled one over and grabbed a wicket to his name. The variety of our bowling unit is immense.</li>
      <li>We had a leg spinner in Aniket who was waiting on the sidelines if needed – thanks for everything you did Aniket, and I'm sure your time will come soon.</li>
      <li>Our field placement is improving as we bowled our 20 overs in the given time, even earlier, so we are starting to do a few things right, while still having room for improvement.</li>
      <li><b>Batting:</b> Job was half done with the way our bowlers bowled. Our discussion in the huddle was simple: don't give them opportunities to catch, play everything on the ground, and punish the loose balls – and the game is ours.</li>
      <li>Credit to the opposition team for bagging 2 of our top batsmen for less than 15 runs. Aiyaz bhai went in at number 4 and was looking good with Aryan, but soon the 3rd wicket fell at 35. Batting was not easy on this track.</li>
      <li>Aryan and Ansh played very sensibly, knocking the ball around, running hard, and punishing everything in their range. We were under a little pressure at 35-3, but Ansh and Aryan saw us through.</li>
      <li><b>Great batting performance from them.</b></li>
      <li><b>Overall:</b> Good victory heading into the bye week being undefeated. Enjoy the week off and keep working hard. Our next game is against the Pacers, who are playing a strong brand of cricket themselves and will put our bowling, batting, and fielding to the test.</li>
      <li><b>Special shout out to Indraj and Sukesh</b> for coming and supporting the team from the sidelines. Having Sukesh on the ground on time gave us the opportunity for a substitute and we sure did utilize it. Again, a winning season is about all collective efforts on and off the field, so let's continue to do that for the remainder of the season.</li>
      <li><b>1..2..3.. Go Glads..!!</b></li>
