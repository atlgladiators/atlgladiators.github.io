      <p><strong>🟢 Toss:</strong> ACZ Gladiators won the toss and chose to bat first.</p>

    <section class="match-summary">
      <h2>🏏 First Innings – Bat First, Set the Tone</h2>
      <p>
        From the toss, the energy was on our side! With <strong>Pavan</strong> anna leading as the new captain, calm and composed, we set out with confidence. A big salute to him for guiding the team so beautifully.
      </p>
      <p>
        The batting began strong, spearheaded by a solid partnership featuring <strong>Nishanth</strong>. Recognition also goes to our stand-in vice captain (you know who you are 😉) – your leadership and motivation lifted all of us. A total of <strong>167</strong> was posted on the board – short by 10-20 runs perhaps, but more than defendable with our versatile bowling attack.

      <h2>🎯 Second Innings – Gladiator Bowling Unit Delivers</h2>
      <p>
        What a clinical display in the second innings! <strong>Rohith</strong> and <strong>Nishanth</strong> again led with early breakthroughs. And then came <strong>Pavan</strong> anna – with a top-class bowling spell on a pitch that gave nothing. His control and consistency were unbelievable. Captain’s performance all the way!
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Sandeep</strong>'s comeback bowled everyone over – fierce and focused. <strong>Akhil</strong> anna was everywhere – helping the skipper with field placements, reading the game, making tactical calls. The MVP energy was real! 💯
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Sukesh</strong>'s wicketkeeping was a game-changer – safe gloves and lightning behind the stumps. Special mention to our two debutants: <strong>Vineet</strong> and <strong>Bharath</strong> – welcome to the Glads arena! That boundary catch by Vineet? 🔥🔥 Instant highlight reel stuff!
