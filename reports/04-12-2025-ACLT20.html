      <strong>Match Summary – Saturday, April 12, 2025</strong>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>
        Another game, another step forward. Although the result didn’t go in our favor, there’s so much to be proud of – and so much to build upon.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h2>Bowling Summary</h2>
    <div class="section">
      <p>
        EC3 won the toss and chose to bat first. We started exceptionally well – a true reflection of our strength as one of the best bowling units in this tournament. We had EC3 reeling at <strong>94/6 after 14 overs</strong>, applying consistent pressure and sticking to our plans. Special shoutout to <strong>Sandeep</strong> for a powerful opening spell, <strong>Trilok</strong> for a brilliant and controlled performance, and our new magician <strong>Bharat</strong>, whose leg spin kept the middle overs tight and produced key wickets.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, the last 6 overs cost us dearly – <strong>83 runs conceded and just 1 wicket</strong>. It was a tough day, especially for Ankit, but remember – one off day doesn’t define our class. We back our bowlers, and we believe in each one of you. Champions bounce back stronger!
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="areas-improve">
      <h2>Takeaways for Improvement</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Control the extras, especially no balls – they turn the momentum quickly.</li>
        <li>Keep it simple – bowl to the field and follow captain’s plan.</li>
        <li>Practice death overs with old balls – the more we simulate match conditions, the sharper we’ll get.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>Batting Summary</h2>
    <div class="section">
      <p>
        It was a tricky pitch with uneven bounce, and our top order had a tough outing. But what stood out was the grit and fight shown by our lower order. From <strong>43/6 in 9.3 overs</strong>, <strong>Ankit and Sushruth</strong> stood tall like true warriors. With support from <strong>Trilok</strong>, they helped us finish at <strong>124/9</strong> – a respectable total that avoided what could’ve been a heavy defeat.
      </p>
      <p>
        The fact that our lower order contributed <strong>81 runs in the final 10.3 overs</strong> is a huge positive. It shows we bat deep, and every player is ready to step up when needed. Hats off to the mindset and skill shown under pressure!
      </p>
      <p>
        We were one solid top-order innings away from turning this into a win. The intent, belief, and effort were all there – and the pieces are falling into place.
      </p>

    <div class="finalwords">
      <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
      <p>
        We are not far from becoming the unstoppable force we know we can be. The Avengers are assembling – it’s only a matter of time before we unleash our full potential. Heads high, spirits up – next game is our bounce back!
