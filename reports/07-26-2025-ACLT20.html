      <h2>🏏 First Innings – Batting Blitz by the Top Order</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Trilok</strong> and <strong>Sukesh</strong> opened the innings, with Sukesh falling early — but that only sparked the storm! Trilok ignited the innings with explosive strokeplay and was absolutely on fire. Both he and his partner built a rock-solid <strong>110-run stand</strong>, dismantling the opposition’s bowlers.
      </p>
      <p>
        The final overs brought in <strong>Prithvi</strong> and <strong>Sandeep</strong>, who didn’t hold back — adding finishing fireworks and pushing the total to a mighty <strong>182/5 in 20 overs</strong>. 🔥

      <h2>🎯 Second Innings – Tactical Brilliance with the Ball</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Trilok</strong> and <strong>Rohith</strong> took the new ball, and Trilok struck early with a key wicket by removing Aryan — a major threat.
      </p>
      <p>
        Though the opposition had a strong powerplay, reaching <strong>71/1 in 6 overs</strong>, our calm and clever vice captain <strong>Pavan</strong> stepped in like a wizard 🧙 and grabbed two crucial wickets to swing the momentum our way.
      </p>
      <p>
        Post the break, <strong>Rohith</strong> bowled a breathtaking maiden over — knocking over Ansh and triggering a quick collapse. <strong>Bharath</strong> followed that up with a double-strike in the same over, putting the brakes firmly on the chase.
      </p>
      <p>
        The death overs were locked down by our ice-veined finisher <strong>Sandeep</strong> and seasoned operator <strong>Akhil</strong> — conceding under 5 runs per over and sealing the match in style. 💪
