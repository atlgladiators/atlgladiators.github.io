    <div class="insights">
    <h2>Match Insights & Highlights for ACZ Gladiators</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Chaotic Batting Start:</strong> The game began on a shaky note due to the unplanned absence of Aftab Bhai. The batting order had to be shuffled last minute, which led to early wickets and a lack of momentum.</li>
        <li><strong>Late Flourish & Key Partnership:</strong> Once Aftab Bhai was finally allowed to bat (after an unfair delay of 3 overs‚Äîsomething we will be taking up with league management), he showed his class and determination. His late flourish, combined with a valuable partnership with Ram, helped us reach a respectable total. Aftab Bhai clearly had a point to prove and delivered under pressure.</li>
        <li><strong>Bowlers & Fielders Shine:</strong> Our bowlers put in a splendid performance, consistently applying pressure with disciplined lines and lengths. The fielders backed them up brilliantly, saving crucial runs throughout the innings.</li>
        <li><strong>Ram‚Äôs Crucial Stop:</strong> In the final over, Ram made a fantastic stop at the boundary, preventing what could have been a match-turning boundary. This moment epitomized our fighting spirit - reminded me of that Ansh's match-winning catch in the first game.</li>
        <li><strong>Aryan‚Äôs Glove Work:</strong> Behind the stumps, Aryan was exceptional, saving at least 10 runs in extras with his sharp glove work. His efforts kept the opposition under constant pressure and helped team morale.</li>
        <li><strong>Winning the Margins:</strong> This was a game of the slimmest of margins. Every run saved and every smart play counted. Congratulations to the whole team for keeping your nerves and executing under pressure!</li>
    </ul>

<div class="improvement">
    <h2>Areas for Improvement</h2>
    <ul>

        <li><strong>Opportunities:</strong> Special mention to Rohit ‚Äî sorry for not being able to get you your chances today. Rest assured, your opportunity will come in the upcoming matches!</li>
    </ul>
