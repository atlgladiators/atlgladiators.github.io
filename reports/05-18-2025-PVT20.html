  <h1>üèè Match Summary: ACZ Gladiators vs Georgia Knights (Paramveer Cricket League) üèè</h1>
  <p>
    A beautiful day for cricket after early morning showers. Our game was delayed by 30 minutes as the morning match ran late, giving us a chance to relax, bond, and have an extended warmup and catch practice. <br>
    Thank you to everyone who showed up at the original reporting time of 1:30pm.

  <h2>Toss & Pitch Report</h2>
  <p>
    The pitch was skiddy but a good batting wicket. The outfield was heavy, so the ball wasn‚Äôt traveling much. With our batting lineup, we knew we had to win the toss, bat first, and put up a defendable total. We won the toss and elected to bat.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <h2>Batting Performance</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Started strong in the powerplay: 16 runs in the first 2 overs (8 runs per over).</li>
    <li>Opposition tightened up from overs 3‚Äì6, boundaries dried up due to heavy, uphill outfield.</li>
    <li>Batsmen adapted, running hard and converting 1s to 2s and 2s to 3s-an area for further improvement in T20 cricket.</li>
    <li>Raeed was the first wicket, out in the 12th over at 69/1.</li>
    <li>Aiyaz bhai entered with a bang-hit a six off his first ball and kept the momentum going.</li>
    <li>Aryan scored a solid 55 off 50 balls, dismissed in the 15th over at 91/2.</li>
    <li>Ansh kept the scoreboard ticking and punished bad balls.</li>
    <li>Aiyaz bhai scored a crucial 31, out in the 19th over at 130/3.</li>
    <li>Akhil ran hard, hit the gaps, and converted runs before a tough LBW decision at 139/4 (second last ball).</li>
    <li>Ram finished the innings with 2 runs off the last ball, pushing the score beyond 140.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    <b>Final Score:</b> 141/4 in 20 overs.<br>
    <span class="highlight">Anything over 140 meant the opposition needed more than 7 runs per over-Game on!</span>
  </p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <h2>Bowling Performance</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>With a heavy outfield and a strong bowling attack, the plan was to avoid overpitched deliveries and make batsmen play off the back foot.</li>
    <li>Govind struck first in his opening over-clean bowled!</li>
    <li>Krishna took 2 wickets in his first over from the other end.</li>
    <li>Akhil bowled a tight spell and was unlucky not to get more wickets-fielding support needed.</li>
    <li>Half the opposition was back in the pavilion at 47-5 in 8.5 overs.</li>
    <li>Sukesh, on Paramveer debut, got his first wicket with a stumps-cartwheeling beauty-score 62-6 in 11.4 overs.</li>
    <li>Ansh took the 7th wicket with a brilliant catch by Akhil on the boundary (15th over, 75-7).</li>
    <li>Krishna returned for his second spell in the 16th over and bagged 2 more wickets, finishing with figures of 4-22-0-4. Could have had a 5-fer with a bit more discipline!</li>
    <li>Ansh finished it in the 19th over with a catch by Akhil at long on.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    <b>Opposition all out for 95.</b> <br>
    <span class="highlight">ACZ Gladiators win by 46 runs-our 4th consecutive victory!</span>
  </p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <h2>Fielding & Team Positives</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Fielding support is crucial-let‚Äôs work on holding onto half-chances to support our bowlers.</li>
    <li>Great catches by Akhil and overall high energy in the field.</li>
    <li>Team bonding and warmup before the game set a positive tone.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <h2>Areas for Improvement</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Batting: We were about 25 runs short-let‚Äôs focus on converting singles and doubles and building partnerships.</li>
    <li>Fielding: Support our bowlers by taking every chance-practice makes perfect!</li>
    <li>Punctuality: Reporting time means being on the ground, ready to go. Arriving late can cost us the impact player option.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    <span class="highlight">Enjoy being 4-0, but let‚Äôs keep working hard for the next challenge!</span>
  </p>
