      <strong>Result: ACZ Gladiators won by 8 wickets</strong>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>
        First of all, extremely proud of our team‚Äôs performance against the Atlanta Knight Riders. This was a comprehensive victory, and it showcased our bowling discipline and our batting composure.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h2>Pre-game Preparation ‚úÖ</h2>
    <div class="section">
      <p>
        One of the key things we did right was ensuring everyone arrived at the ground well before the scheduled start. That gave us time for kit distribution and pre-game activities.<br>
        We also got ample time for a thorough warmup, keeper practice, and a focused catching practice session.<br>
        The energy and attention during these drills set a positive tone for the day.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h2>Toss & Bowling Performance üí™üèºüí™üèº</h2>
    <div class="section">
      <p>
        We lost the toss and were put into the field first.<br>
        Our bowlers responded brilliantly to the challenge, executing our plans with precision.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Special mention to Ansh</strong> - the well-deserved MoM of the game. He was outstanding with the ball, taking <strong>5 wickets in just 2 overs</strong> and completely dismantling the opposition‚Äôs middle and lower order.<br>
        Krishna bowled with great control, picking up <strong>2 wickets for only 8 runs in his 3 overs</strong>.<br>
        Govind and Akhil supported well, each taking a wicket and keeping the pressure on with tight lines.<br>
        We still had Sukesh, Rahul, Alok, and Noman bhai available to bowl, which shows the depth of our bowling strength.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our fielding was sharp, highlighted by a crucial run-out from Raeed, which further derailed the Knight Riders‚Äô innings.<br>
        Shout out to Ankit for coming in as a Sub fielder, which helped the team keep up the pressure in outfield, on a scorching hot day.<br>
        We kept the energy high and didn‚Äôt allow any partnerships to settle. The opposition was bowled out for just <strong>55 runs in 11 overs</strong>, a testament to our collective effort and focus.
      </p>
      <p>
        One thing we can improve upon is our slower over rate. With better understanding of fielding positions and quicker field changes, we should strive to get better at it.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h2>Batting Chase üèèüèè</h2>
    <div class="section">
      <p>
        Chasing a modest target of 56, we aimed to keep things simple and not take unnecessary risks.<br>
        Aryan anchored the chase with a steady <strong>23 not out</strong>, showing maturity and calmness at the crease.<br>
        Raeed provided a brisk start, and Noman bhai finished things off with a quick <strong>8 not out</strong>, including a six that sealed the win.<br>
        Despite losing a couple of wickets, we reached the target in just <strong>7.3 overs</strong>.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="appreciation">
      <h2>Strong Support on the Sidelines</h2>
      <p>
        Shout out to <strong>Meghal, Sandeep, and Indraj</strong> for showing up to support and cheer on fellow Gladiators team members.<br>
        Thanks to all of our supporters and the team for their well wishes and dedication.
